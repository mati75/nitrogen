Description: wallpaper browser and changing utility for X
 nitrogen is a graphical wallpaper utility that can be used in two
 modes, browser and recall.
 Some of the things to look for in nitrogen are:
 .
  * Multihead and Xinerama support (setting
    different wallpapers for each monitor)
  * Recall mode to restore wallpapers via startup script
  * Uses freedesktop.org standard for thumbnails
  * Can set GNOME background
  * Command line set modes for script usage
  * Inotify monitoring of browsed directories
